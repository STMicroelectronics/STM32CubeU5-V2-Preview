# Contributing Guide

The feedback from the community is essential, to ensure that the STM32Cube HAL2 drivers meet the needs of developers and provide a solid foundation for application development on STM32 microcontrollers. 
We are looking for feedback both on the improvements and regressions you encounter. Your feedback is important to us. It will be taken into consideration for the final release of the STM32Cube HAL2 drivers, or as part of the future roadmap.
