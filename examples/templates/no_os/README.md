# __Template: *template_no_os*__

[![User Manual](doc/read_the-UM.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/latest/ "Online documentation.")

This set of template files initiates __bare-metal C projects leveraging the STM32Cube HAL__
with the `Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)` supported in the STM32Cube ecosystem.


## __1. Content Description__

This template application project initiates a bare-metal C project.
It integrates all the required startup files and HAL drivers to initialize the system.
This template application creates a single binary that can use the entire memory layout and system resources.

The template files are used to:

- `Start an IDE project` with your preferred IDE.

These template files encompass:

- Platform and IDE agnostic template files in the `application/` folder.
- Target specific files (one folder per STM32 board, for example: `NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q/`).

These target specific files belong to two categories.

The `IDE_name` folder of the chosen STM32 board collects the project files:

    - The supported IDEs native project files.

The `generated/` folder of the chosen STM32 board collects the hardware-specific C code:

    - Application specific files (linker scripts, device startup files...).
    - STM32 board parts initialization and configuration files (LED, button...).
    - STM32 peripherals initialization and configuration files (HAL code for clock configuration...).


## __2. Software Environment and how to use the template__

The template project files facilitate the creation of an application using the tools of your choice.

### __2.1. With one of the STM32Cube ecosystem IDEs__

You just need to open the IDE project files present in the `.cube` folder of the `STM32 board` you are interested in.
The IDE initiates the project with the reference files, and you can complete it as per your needs.

### __2.2. With any other IDE of your choice__

You just need to create a project of your own and import the reference C code (`application/` and `generated/` folders).

The `main.c` file initiates the system setup by calling the `mx_system_init()`, which handles the
HAL (hardware abstraction layer) initialization. It also initializes all the peripherals, the flash interface,
the system clock, and the SysTick.


## __3. Configuration__

### __3.1. Default Configuration__

This template application runs from the internal flash.

The system configuration aims at offering the optimal MCU performances:

- The system clock is set to its maximum speed.
- All optimization paths are enabled (instruction cache, data cache...).
- All configured resources are clocked to reach their maximum performances.

> **_NOTE:_** This configuration is optimized for best performance but not for low-power consumption.

### __3.2 Special configuration cases__

__STM32 with isolation__

The infrastructure for resource isolation is configured in the initialization phase.
The resource isolation allows making the entire chip a secure privilege, including controller and target peripherals.
All this is done in the `mx_tee_setup()' code.

## __4. Troubleshooting__

Here are some typical points of attention in case of issues.

### __4.1. General Debug Tips__

#### __4.1.1. Flashing issues__

1. Try flashing using `STM32CubeProgrammer`.
2. Check the device configuration against the description in the STM32 system memory boot mode application note.

#### __4.1.2 Startup issues__

1. Read the flash or RAM content using `STM32CubeProgrammer` to make sure the code you expect to run is loaded in the device.
2. Check the boot options of your device (boot pins...) in the reference manual.
3. Try connecting to the board and use a debugger to spot any hard fault in the code.

#### __4.1.3 Issues to connect to the board__

Possible issues are:

1. The firmware running on the target is forcing a low-power mode.
The communication with STLINK is disabled when the board is in low-power mode.

2. The target is secured or debug-disabled.

#### __4.1.4. HAL timing issues__

Care must be taken when using `HAL_Delay()`,
this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR.

This implies that if `HAL_Delay()` is called from a peripheral ISR process,
then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt.
Otherwise, the caller ISR process is blocked.
To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use `HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()` function.

The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

### __4.2 Fault Exceptions__

Arm CortexÂ®-M processors implement an efficient exception model that traps illegal memory accesses and
several incorrect program conditions.
The HardFault exception is always enabled and has a fixed priority (higher than other interrupts and exceptions,
but lower than non-maskable interrupt NMI). The HardFault exception is therefore executed in cases where a
fault exception is disabled or when a fault occurs during the execution of a fault exception handler.

All other fault exceptions (MemManage fault, BusFault, UsageFault...) have a programmable priority.
After reset, these exceptions are disabled and may be enabled in the system or application software
using the registers in the System Control Block (SCB).

### __4.3 Debug Toolbox__

Refer to the [STM32 debug toolbox](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an4989-stm32-microcontroller-debug-toolbox-stmicroelectronics.pdf)
for further information about how to troubleshoot the problem.
